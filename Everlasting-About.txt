Everlasting.exe is a piece of ransomware designed by me.

It doesn't actually work as ransomware, as the BTC address is fake in the ransom note. However, the malware itself works (it's changes to the system, file moving, file perms, registry stuff, and much more).

So, I invite you to check it out! Just run it on a VM, and read the README file first, with anything else in there that looks usful as well. Source code included.
